# DeepDuck
It's a project for me to learn and get better with `C++`. Will see where this takes me. DeepDuck is supposed to be a hobby chess engine.

## How to build
You'll need a `C++17` compiler and `Make` to build it.

#### 1. Run this command in the directory which contains the `Makefile`
```
make
```
#### 2. When the complier compiles the project you can run the executable
```
./bin/chess
```
#### 3. This will remove all the compiled files and executable
```
make clean
```
